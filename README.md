## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 Disables all system-level thermal daemons and services.  
- 🎮 Ensures stable gaming performance without FPS drops.  
- ⚡ Boosts sustained performance under heavy loads.  
- 🧩 Plug-and-play — no configuration required.  
- 🪶 Lightweight and clean script execution.

## 🧠 How It Works

Antares Thermal Killer targets and neutralizes system processes and configuration files related to:
- /system/bin/thermal*
- /vendor/bin/thermal*
- /system/etc/thermal*
- /vendor/etc/thermal*

By bypassing these thermal management components, the CPU and GPU maintain peak performance throughout demanding gaming sessions.
